This document summarizes the custom additions made to the DJI Mobile SDK sample app.

- **ONNX model support** using `OnnxModelLoader.kt` and `ModelRunner.kt`.  Models can be loaded from the APK assets or from external storage such as the SD card.
- **Video stream processing** in `VideoChannelFragment` calls `ModelRunner.runAndBlur` so each YUV frame from the camera is analyzed by the ONNX model.
- **Configurable gaussian blur** is applied to detected objects whose labels are listed in `blur_config.json`.

These features enable real-time object detection on the drone video feed with selective blurring of sensitive content.
